# page-mover
This is a browser extension that can move pages by hotkeys, like vim (h, j, k, l) or a gamer (w, a, s, d) etc.

## Hotkeys:
* h, j ,k ,l and a, s, w, d = left, up, down, right
* g, g+shift = go to top, go to bottom
* i, m = up, down (by slow scrolling speed)

(If it doesn't work in Firefox, you can give the "Access your data for all websites" permission to make it work.)
